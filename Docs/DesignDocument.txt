Problem
---
Users want to use our API as middleware to get data from two endpoints from `http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`. Namely `/photos` and `/albums`.

Requirements
---
* 1 API endpoint that combines the results of `/photos` and `/albums`
* Allow users to filter the result by a single `user id` on the `albums` object

Approach
---
* Use REST API and create 2 endpoints:
	1. `/api/albums`, which returns all albums
	1. `/api/:userId/albums`, which returns all albums specific to that user
	
Architecture
---
* User one project for the `API`, which will act as a communications layer
* Another project for `Services`, where all of the logic will live
* Create a `UnitTest` (name TBD) project to test all the logic in `Services`
